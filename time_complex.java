//Lecture 9 - Time and Space Complexity

//Time complexity - 

//Relation between input size & Running Time Operation

//Best Case    - omega(1)
//Average Case - theta((n+1)/2)
//Worst Case   - O(n)


//Space Complexity -

//Size of variables
//like n is considered which is constant then space complexity will be constant for that code
//if arrays then space complexity will change because array size is not constant
